# Movies for Munchies

## User Story
* I have made a meal for myself and want to relax while I'm eating with a film
* I spend hours scrolling through various streaming services but am overwhelmed by the choice
* My food gets cold before the movie starts

I WANT a service that will choose my film for me based on what I'm eating SO THAT I no longer spend so long searching for a film that my food gets cold.

## Installation

Uses html, CSS (utilising Bootstrap) and JavaScript. 
2 APIs enable the search functionality of the website: 
MealDB and The Movie DB. Meal DB does not require an API key. An API Key for The Movie DB can be found on line 51 of the javascript file. 

## Features

* Automatic movie recommendation based on the user's meal
* Seamless integration of MealDB and The Movie DB APIs
* Responsive design for optimal viewing on different devices

## Usage

A deployed version of our website can be found at [Movies for Munchies](https://prangchira.github.io/Project-1/)

## Future Improvements

To develop this website further we would implement the following updates

* Integration of streaming services so users could find where to stream the suggested movies
* Personalised recommendations based on user preferences
* Link to recipes of the meal searched for users to follow
